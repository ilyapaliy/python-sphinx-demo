# Python-Sphinx-Demo
A demonstration on how to automatically create documentation.

Link to gh-pages: https://plasmatech8.github.io/Python-Sphinx-Demo/

## Good Easy-to-Use Way 

To set up your documentation you should:
1. Copy and paste the docs folder into your project.
2. Run initdocs.bat to set up .rst files for your python files in mypackage.
3. Edit your .rst files to create appropriate webpages in docs/source/
4. Run builddocs.bat to generate .html files.

5. Publish to github pages:

To publish to gh-pages you can either use the gh-pages branch (which is set by default), or you can use the docs/ folder as your gh-pages html folder. Where gh-pages looks to find your .html files depends on the github pages settings of your github repo.

It is recommended to use method 2a.

1. Publish to the gh-pages branch
		
	a. Use **pushdocs.bat**. This will use git subtree push to find your files under docs/build/html/ and push it to the gh-pages branch. This method is slow because it must iterate over every commit in the gh-pages branch before pushing the contents.
	
	b. Use **pushdocs2.bat**. This will clone the gh-pages branch into a new folder (outside of the main project folder) and copy all files from docs/build/html/ into it. It will then add, commit and push it to the remote gh-pages branch. This folder is named '<YOUR PROJECT>-docs (1)' and a new folder is created and the number is incremented for each time pushdocs2 is executed. 
	
	c. Use **pushdocs3.bat**. This will do the same as pushdocs2 except it will delete the folder named '<YOUR PROJECT>-docs' before cloning the branch. This method avoids creating duplicates.
2. Set gh-pages settings to use the docs/ folder and redirect the user to the documentation. (RECOMMENDED)
	
	a. Go into your github project settings>GitHub Pages>Source. You will be able to change the setting from **gh-pages branch** to **master branch /docs folder**. In your docs/ folder, you must then make sure that a .nojekyll file exists and a .html file exists which redirects the user to the location of the documentation (docs/build/html/index.html).

## Manual Instructions

Getting started:
1. mkdir docs
2. cd docs
3. sphinx-quickstart
4. make html
5. Inspect the pages at docs/build/html/index.html

Manually updating or adding custom pages:
1. Update docs/source/conf.py whenever you please.
	* Change html_theme = 'nature'
2. Update the rst files to add more webpages.
	* Add stuff to docs/source/index.rst
	* Add more rst files and add it to docs/source/index.rst
3. make html

Automatically python documentation files:
1. Open docs/source/conf.py
2. Make sure that the following lines are not commented:
	```
	import os
	import sys
	sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))
	```
3. Insert the reletive path to your code.
i.e.
	```
	sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../../mypackage/'))
	```
4. sphinx-apidoc -f -o source/ ../mypackage/

	mypackage contains all code that we want to document.
5. make html

Creating a github-pages branch for hosting the documentation:
1. Go outside your entire project.
2. mkdir Python-Sphinx-Demo-docs
3. cd Python-Sphinx-Demo-docs
4. git clone https://github.com/[user]/[repository].git html
	
	(git clone https://github.com/plasmatech8/Python-Sphinx-Demo.git html)
	
5. cd html
6. git branch gh-pages
7. git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/gh-pages
8. rm .git/index
9. git clean -fdx
10. git branch #to check  to make sure we are in the gh-pages branch
11. copy the build html files to the html folder (make html)
12. git add .
13. git commit -m "Rebuilt docs"
14. git push origin gh-pages
15. Go to https://[user].github.io/[repository]/

# Quickstart Command

Command:

	> sphinx-quickstart

Options:

	Welcome to the Sphinx 1.8.2 quickstart utility.

	Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
	accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

	Selected root path: .

	You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
	Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
	"source" and "build" directories within the root path.
	> Separate source and build directories (y/n) [n]: y

	Inside the root directory, two more directories will be created; "_templates"
	for custom HTML templates and "_static" for custom stylesheets and other static
	files. You can enter another prefix (such as ".") to replace the underscore.
	> Name prefix for templates and static dir [_]:

	The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
	> Project name: Python-Sphinx-Demo
	> Author name(s): Mark Connelly
	> Project release []: 0.0.1

	If the documents are to be written in a language other than English,
	you can select a language here by its language code. Sphinx will then
	translate text that it generates into that language.

	For a list of supported codes, see
	http://sphinx-doc.org/config.html#confval-language.
	> Project language [en]:

	The file name suffix for source files. Commonly, this is either ".txt"
	or ".rst".  Only files with this suffix are considered documents.
	> Source file suffix [.rst]:

	One document is special in that it is considered the top node of the
	"contents tree", that is, it is the root of the hierarchical structure
	of the documents. Normally, this is "index", but if your "index"
	document is a custom template, you can also set this to another filename.
	> Name of your master document (without suffix) [index]:
	Indicate which of the following Sphinx extensions should be enabled:
	> autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/n) [n]: y
	> doctest: automatically test code snippets in doctest blocks (y/n) [n]:
	> intersphinx: link between Sphinx documentation of different projects (y/n) [n]:
	> todo: write "todo" entries that can be shown or hidden on build (y/n) [n]: y
	> coverage: checks for documentation coverage (y/n) [n]:
	> imgmath: include math, rendered as PNG or SVG images (y/n) [n]: n
	> mathjax: include math, rendered in the browser by MathJax (y/n) [n]: y
	> ifconfig: conditional inclusion of content based on config values (y/n) [n]:
	> viewcode: include links to the source code of documented Python objects (y/n) [n]: y
	> githubpages: create .nojekyll file to publish the document on GitHub pages (y/n) [n]: y

	A Makefile and a Windows command file can be generated for you so that you
	only have to run e.g. `make html' instead of invoking sphinx-build
	directly.
	> Create Makefile? (y/n) [y]: y
	> Create Windows command file? (y/n) [y]: y

	Creating file .\source\conf.py.
	Creating file .\source\index.rst.
	Creating file .\Makefile.
	Creating file .\make.bat.

	Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

	You should now populate your master file .\source\index.rst and create other documentation
	source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
	make builder
	where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.
